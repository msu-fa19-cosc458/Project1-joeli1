<h1>Project 1</h1>
<h4>What was the theme you chose?</h4>
<p>I made my project theme based on women in music. The first person to come to mind for me who is a great entertainer is Beyonce. She'll go down as one of the greats! Some other greats are Rihanna and Mariah Carey. All 3 are legends in their own right!<br>
<h4>How did you pick your searches to fit the theme?</h4>
<p>The project is set to search based on the artist -- this artist being Beyonce.<br>
<h4>What are at least 3 issues you encountered with your project? How did you fix them?</h4>
<p>1. I followed the powerpoint slides to create the project and the powerpoint said to add a "-" to the ed of the authentication bearer but that didb't work so i had issues with that.<br>
<p>2. Trying to push to heroku was a STRUGGLE! To fix my deployment issue, I had to update my requirements file.<br>
<p>3. I wasn't sure how the tweets should appear. I have the tweets at the bottom but it doesn't always display the name of the user.<br>
<h4>What are known problems, if any, with your project?</h4>
<p>I don't know how to filter the tweets to keep them PG or PG-13. Please excuse any tweets that don't follow those guidelines.<br>
<h4>What would you do to improve your project in the future?</h4>
<p>I want to update the styling to make it more user friendly.<br>
